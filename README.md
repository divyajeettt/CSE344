# CSE344: Computer Vision

## About CSE344

**[CSE344: *Computer Vision*](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE344)** is a 3xx-level course offered to undergrads pursuing the CSAI and ECE disciplines at IIIT-Delhi. The goal of this course is to develop the fundamental concepts of Computer Vision in students and develop applications using existing tools. It aims to enable students to:

- apply [Feature Extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering), Representation, [Tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_tracking), [Segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation), and object detection and recognition on images
- understand ideas from single and multi-view geometries with depth and [3D Estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_pose_estimation)
- evaluate and compare the quantitative performance of vision algorithms by using appropriate metrics
- implement solutions to relevant problems using existing tools
